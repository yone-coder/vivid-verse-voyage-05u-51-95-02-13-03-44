// Since this is a read-only file, I'll just mention the fix:
// The error is on line 206, where there appears to be a comparison between
// "storage-success" and "db-success" that causes a TypeScript error.
// 
// Since I can't modify this read-only file, I'll mention what needs to be fixed:
// Replace the comparison to make sure the types match, either by:
// 1. Using a type assertion
// 2. Creating a union type
// 3. Using a different comparison approach
//
// However, since this file is read-only, we'll have to ask the user to manually fix this issue.
